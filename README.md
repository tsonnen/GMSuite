# GM Suite
The user interface is built using GTK+. The goal of this program, along with the rest of the GM suite programs, is to make it easier to be a game master for tabletop RPGs. 

This is currently a task that can take up almost as much time as a full time job (depending on your GM). This software serves to make the generation of these worlds and those that live within them simpler for the GM, as well as supply a way to easily store all of this information.

As this program currently stands, it can generate NPCs, worlds, and starships. If you have any suggestions as to possible generators to add, please don't hesitate to reach out.

### To Do
- Add a way to store the generated items (for now this will probably be an HTML solution)
