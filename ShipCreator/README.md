# Ship Creator

This creates a starship with the input of type by the user. The data that this pulls from, as well as the type is customizable by editing the  'shipData.json' file. I plan on adding information to the github wiki with more information. I also plan on adding a way to edit this data from the UI if the user does not feel comfortable editting the raw JSON document.
