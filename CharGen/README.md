# Character-Generator
The user interface is built using GTK+. The goal of this program, along with the rest of the GM suite programs, is to make it easier to be a game master for tabletop RPGs. 
This is currently a task that can take up almost as much time as a full time job (depinding on your GM). This software serves to make the generation of these worlds and those that live within them simpler for the GM, as well as supply a way to easily store all of this information.
The end goal is to have several stand alone applications, as well as a SQL, in some flavor, database that will store all of this information and make it easily accessable for the GM as well as players.
