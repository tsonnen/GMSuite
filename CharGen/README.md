# Character Generator

This creates an NPC with the input of system, class, and race. All of these selections as well as the other data is customizable by simply editing the  'charData.json' file. I plan on adding information to the github wiki with more information. I also plan on adding a way to edit this data from the UI if the user does not feel comfortable editting the raw JSON document.
