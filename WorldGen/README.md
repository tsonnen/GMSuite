# World Generator

This creates a world with no input from the user. The data that this pulls from is customizable by editing the  'worldData.json' file. I plan on adding information to the github wiki with more information. I also plan on adding a way to edit this data from the UI if the user does not feel comfortable editting the raw JSON document.
